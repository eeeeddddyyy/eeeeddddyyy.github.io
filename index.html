        <p>Web Developer | Designer | Student</p>

        <img src="me.jpg" alt="" />

        <p> I am an information technology student majoring in Web Technology and this is the project that I worked on.</p>

        <p> I have a big dream that I am constantly working towards, but admittedly, sometimes I can be a bit lazy. However, I make a conscious effort to stay motivated and push myself to achieve my goals. I find that learning new things and helping others is a great source of inspiration for me.

            When I'm faced with challenges, I try my best to stay positive and keep moving forward. I believe that a positive attitude and mindset can make all the difference in overcoming obstacles.
            
            I'm an introverted person by nature, and I value my alone time. I need to recharge and reflect on my thoughts. But at the same time, I also enjoy being around people and socializing with friends. When my mood is good, I tend to be more extroverted and outgoing.
            
            All in all, I'm someone who is always striving to better myself and help those around me in any way I can.</p>
